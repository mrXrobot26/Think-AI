    "# When To Use & Not To Use For Each Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "- **When to Use:**\n",
    "  - If you want to predict an employee's salary based on **only one feature**, like years of experience.  \n",
    "  - The relationship is typically linear: as years of experience increase, salary also increases proportionally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **When Not to Use:**\n",
    "  - If you're analyzing something like the effect of experience, certifications, and age on salary, as you have multiple independent variables in this case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "- **When to Use:**\n",
    "  - Predicting the price of an apartment based on multiple factors, such as:\n",
    "    - Area (in square meters).  \n",
    "    - Number of rooms.  \n",
    "    - Location.  \n",
    "  - Here, there are many independent variables, and each one influences the dependent variable (price).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **When Not to Use:**\n",
    "  - If the relationship between variables is not linear, like when the price increases in a curve rather than a straight line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Polynomial Linear Regression**\n",
    "- **When to Use:**\n",
    "  - If you want to predict something that follows a **non-linear relationship**, like the movement of a car on a mountainous road (ups and downs).  \n",
    "  - For example, the relationship might look like this:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + b_3x^3\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  - Polynomial regression works well in cases where the data shows curves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **When Not to Use:**\n",
    "  - If the relationship is very complex or if there are many dimensions (features).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**\n",
    "- **When to Use:**\n",
    "  - If you want to predict gold prices based on complex and non-linear factors, like:\n",
    "    - Global market trends.  \n",
    "    - USD exchange rates.  \n",
    "    - Demand for gold.  \n",
    "  - SVR performs very well with non-linear and complex data relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **When Not to Use:**\n",
    "  - If the dataset is small, as SVR needs sufficient data to provide accurate predictions.  \n",
    "\n",

    "| Simple Linear         | Linear relationship between X and Y.                      | Too simple when multiple variables are involved. |\n",
    "| Multiple Linear       | More than one X influencing Y linearly.                   | Doesn't handle non-linear relationships well.  |\n",
    "| Polynomial Regression | Non-linear relationships with simple curves.              | May cause overfitting if the degree is too high. |\n",
    "| SVR                   | Complex, non-linear data or data with many dimensions.    | Slow and computationally expensive for large datasets. |\n",
