## ðŸš€ Projects & Contributions  

### Implemented Models:  
1. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - First implemented regression model, focusing on understanding linear relationships.  
2. **Polynomial Regression**  
   - Added support for modeling non-linear data.  
3. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
   - Integrated SVR for adaptable regression on non-linear data.  
4. **Decision Tree Regression**  
   - Implemented decision tree-based regression for interpretable predictions.  
5. **Random Forest Regression**  
   - Built a model leveraging ensemble techniques for improved accuracy and robustness.  

### Generic Template  
- **Regression & Data Preprocessing**  
  - Created a reusable and efficient generic template for regression workflows and data preprocessing.  

### Documentation  
- **README.md**  
  - Provided clear documentation to guide contributors and showcase the repositoryâ€™s purpose.
