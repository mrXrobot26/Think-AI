## ðŸš€ Projects & Contributions  

### Implemented Models:  
1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
   - Developed a foundational regression model to understand basic linear relationships.  
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Extended to handle multiple features for better predictions.  
3. **Polynomial Regression**  
   - Enhanced the model to capture non-linear patterns in data.  
4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
   - Integrated SVR to handle complex and non-linear relationships.  
5. **Decision Tree Regression**  
   - Implemented decision tree-based regression for interpretable and rule-based predictions.  
6. **Random Forest Regression**  
   - Leveraged ensemble techniques for improved accuracy and robustness.  
7. **Logistic Regression (Classification)**  
   - Introduced a classification model to handle binary and multi-class classification tasks.  
8. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification**  
   - Built a simple yet effective classifier based on proximity to labeled data points.  
9. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification**  
   - Implemented SVM to find the optimal hyperplane for classification.  
10. **Naive Bayes Classification**  
    - Applied probabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem.  
11. **K-Means Clustering**  
    - Developed an unsupervised clustering model to group similar data points.  
12. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
    - Implemented a hierarchical approach to cluster analysis for a better understanding of data structures.  

### Data Preprocessing  
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
  - Covered techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and outlier detection.  

### Generic Template  
- **Regression & Data Preprocessing**  
  - Created a reusable and efficient generic template for regression workflows and data preprocessing, covering data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding techniques.  

### Documentation  
- **README.md**  
  - Provided comprehensive documentation to guide contributors and showcase the repositoryâ€™s purpose and usage.
